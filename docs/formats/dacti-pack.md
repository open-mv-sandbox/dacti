| Dacti Index Component | 2c5e4717-b715-429b-85cd-d320d242547a | 0.1.0-draft ðŸš§ |

## Motivation

- Direct addressing. Dacti packages do not require any special parsing or decompressing at a package level to access the inner data, and all indices are stored as fixed offsets and sizes. This allows areas to be directly addressed through, for example, [HTTP Range Requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Range_requests).
