# Dacti Docs

The dacti format is built up from multiple smaller components. These components are in turn based on the [Daicon Container Format](daicon.md). If you are not familiar with Daicon, read that specification first.

## File Formats

- [Dacti Package Format (and associated Dacti Package Metadata)](formats/package.md)
- [Dacti Object Format](formats/object.md)

## Interfaces

The file formats use common daicon interfaces for interoperability.

- [Dacti Data Index Interface](interfaces/data-index.md)
- [Dacti Cross-Reference Interface](interfaces/cross-reference.md)
